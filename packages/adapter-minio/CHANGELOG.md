# @genoacms/adapter-minio

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/GenoaCMS/genoacms/pull/22) [`813d2b5`](https://github.com/GenoaCMS/genoacms/commit/813d2b5ec6841e155cd697e45dccdb42e7f9c3d0) Thanks [@Hejtmus](https://github.com/Hejtmus)! - The storage contract gains `ObjectNotFoundError`: reading or deleting a missing object rejects with `storage/not-found` on every adapter. A directory's name is `''` or ends in `/`, and other names are refused with `storage/not-a-directory`. Listings page with an opaque `next` token, and core and `genoa database` follow every page. `gzip` is removed from `UploadOptions`. The MinIO adapter now serves any S3-compatible server that honours conditional writes (tested against RustFS), and the conformance suite checks the whole storage contract.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`813d2b5`](https://github.com/GenoaCMS/genoacms/commit/813d2b5ec6841e155cd697e45dccdb42e7f9c3d0)]:
  - @genoacms/contracts@0.0.3

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [`7a8ce2a`](https://github.com/GenoaCMS/genoacms/commit/7a8ce2a89b12bd7c99419456e27a670f555b79cb) Thanks [@Hejtmus](https://github.com/Hejtmus)! - Ported to the new config format (RFC-0006 to RFC-0010, RFC-0012, RFC-0014): each adapter exports a descriptor that `@genoacms/config` loads by package name from `genoa.config/`, and implements `@genoacms/contracts`. Configs written for `@genoacms/cloudabstraction` no longer load.
